        <p>This is some information about Yingjie Mu...</p>
        <p>Hello, I’m Yingjie Mu, a passionate and dedicated designer specializing in Digital Media and Technology. My journey began at the prestigious Central Academy of Fine Arts, where I honed my skills in Visual Communication, and has since taken me to the vibrant academic halls of Parsons School of Design. Here, I've expanded my expertise into dynamic and interactive design, exploring how digital forms intersect with everyday life.</p>
        <p>Currently, as a graduate student, I am deeply engaged in projects that merge design with digital technology, focusing on how data becomes a canvas for creativity. My work often reflects on the intersection of surveillance, data privacy, and the commodification of personal information, striving to make visible the invisible forces of our digital age.</p>
        <p>Whether through academic projects, professional work, or personal explorations, my goal is to challenge the boundaries of traditional design and technology, creating meaningful and thought-provoking interactions.</p>
